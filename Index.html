<h1>
  Sports are Essential to Life
</h1>
<p>
  Most of life has been dedicated to sports. Sports have been a way for me to find relaxation, and releave stress. I know that one day sports will end, but I will still find a way to particpate in some fashion. I have been playing since the third grade, and I realize that because of sports I am able to live a healthy lifestyle.
